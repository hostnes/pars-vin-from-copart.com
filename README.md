If you try to run main.py you will see that console print "Enter site link: " after this line you should enter the link on the site which you want to pars [exaple]([http://example.com](https://www.copart.com/lotSearchResults?free=true&query=buick%20encore%20gx)https://www.copart.com/lotSearchResults?free=true&query=buick%20encore%20gx). since the site loads data dynamically using js, we can't just send a request on this link, because we will get a blank page, so selenium was used. Then script finds all references to cars [example](https://www.copart.com/lot/64734303/salvage-2020-buick-encore-gx-select-ky-lexington-west). script opens each reference and find vin code on html example="W04GM6SX1K1******", and we see that last 6 chars are hidden, but on the photo we can see full vin number [example](https://cs.copart.com/v1/AUTH_svc.pdoc00001/lpp/0823/ea252b760145441e8debfc074b4887b7_ful.jpg). so then i decide to use pytesseract to find text in photo, i had cases where pytesseract found "â€ " instead of 4, wich was a big problem. it was happening because pytesseract found all chars on all languages. latter i found an another library "easyocr" in this library you can choose the language to found the text in photo, and this problem was solved.
